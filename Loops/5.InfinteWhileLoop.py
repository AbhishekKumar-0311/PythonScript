# to create a infinte loop in condion give such condtion which is always true then that block of code infintely runs

#Example 1
i=1
while(i!=10):
    i=i+2
    print(i)

#here we provide condition i!=10 which is always give output as true then this will run infinte times

#Example 2

# while True:
#     print('HI')

#in this example write True in condition
