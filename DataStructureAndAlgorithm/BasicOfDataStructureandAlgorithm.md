## Data Structure And Algorithm


### Data Structure
- Data Structure is a way of storing and organising information
in systematic way so we can we retrieved and handled more efficiently and more productively.
- data structure is a data organizations, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
-An Efficient program executes faster and helps minimize resources like disk,chip,memory.

#### There are two type of data structures

#### 1.Primitive Data Structures
- Primitive types are the most basic data types available within any programing language.
- Primitive data types are predefined types of data, which are supported by the programming language.
- To handle primitive data types such as int,float in efficient way called primitive data structure.

Examples:
```
- integer
- float
- boolean
- string
```

#### 2.Abstract Data Structures.
- Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.
- We have some abstract data types such as stack queue,linked list,graph,tree to handle these type of data in appropriate way we need abstract data structures.
- Abstract Data type don't just store a value, but rather a collection of values in various formats.

Examples:
```
- Array
- List
- Stack
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Set
- Files
- Queue
```


### Algorithm:
- Algorithm is a set of rules or logic defined in proper flow to complete a predefined task.
- A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
- Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
- A set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations called an algorithm.
- Algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce output from given (perhaps null) input.
- An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher time complexity) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; 
that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.
- Algorithm can be expressed either as an informal high level description as pseudo code or using a flowchart. 
- If algorithm is efficient and fast then our data structures of programming is good.

#### How to decide that algorithm is efficient & fast?
If algorithm takes less amount of time to execute a program(or solve a problem) and consume less amount of memory on disk then
we can call such algorithm as efficient,fast and appropriate.

The performance of an algorithm can be depend upon following two properties
1.space complexity.
2.time complexity.


**1. Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity is a function or method that gives the amount of time required by an algorithm to perform a specific Task.

**2. Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is a function or method that gives the amount of space required by an algorithm to perform a specific Task.

**Note**:There are many solution ,algorithm to perform a specific task  but choose those algorithm which have higher performance in the term of space and time.
